### Gameplay

This is a top-down spaceship shooter with RPG elements. Salvage parts off the enemy ships you destroy, to increase your ship's power. Rather than
collecting fully working ship upgrades, you must collect multiple inner components of a part before having a functioning version. You can then upgrade that part with new components as you go. But you must be careful; too much damage to your ship will leave your parts with broken components, and no way to fix them.

The type of ship you build is entirely up to you. Ships are constructed from a core block (containing the pilot), and all attachable parts have their own hull. If you have ever played Battleships Forever or Warning Forever, these ships will look similar to that, but each part hull has a specific purpose.

The types of parts available will vary widely, enabling many strategies in engaging enemies. You may choose to attack with lots of machine guns, or large cannons. You might prefer rockets, or rely on beam cannons. You could even go for stealthy options, and hack the computers of your oponents until their systems fail. Defensive options will vary just as much.

You will face a wide variety of enemy ships, from different species. Each will attack you in different ways. Resources and energy will be a constant concern. Various engine types will provide power from different sources, some cheaper to operate than others. Certain weapons (and defensive measures) will demand great shifts in power flow, which can only be handled with energy capacitors.
